**Company Size**: Small business (2-5 employees)  
**Location**: United States  
**Website**: [Placeholder URL]

## Challenge

Luxe Candle Co. was struggling to convert Instagram traffic into actual sales. Their existing Shopify store had several critical issues:

- **Poor Mobile Experience**: 73% of visitors came from mobile, but the checkout flow was clunky and confusing
- **High Cart Abandonment**: 73% cart abandonment rate (industry average is ~69%)
- **Slow Load Times**: Average page load of 4.2 seconds on mobile
- **Too Many Products**: 45+ SKUs overwhelmed customers and diluted focus
- **Generic Design**: Template-based store that didn't reflect their premium brand positioning

The founder had invested $3,000 in the original Shopify setup but saw minimal ROI after 6 months.

## Our Approach

### Discovery (Days 1-2)

- Analyzed existing analytics: 78% mobile traffic, highest bounce rate on product pages
- Reviewed Instagram content: Strong brand aesthetic, engaged audience of 12K followers
- Heat map analysis: Customers confused by navigation, abandoned at shipping calculator
- Competitor analysis: Identified 3 key UX patterns from successful candle brands

### Strategy

We recommended a focused 3-page store optimized for mobile-first purchasing:

1. **Streamlined Product Selection**: Feature 8 best-sellers only
2. **One-Click Checkout**: Implement Apple Pay and Google Pay
3. **Mobile-Optimized Design**: Large touch targets, simplified navigation
4. **Fast Loading**: Optimize images, eliminate unnecessary scripts
5. **Instagram Integration**: Direct product tagging and seamless experience

### Execution (Days 3-7)

**Homepage**:
- Hero video (15s loop) showing candles in lifestyle settings
- Featured collection grid with large product images
- Social proof: "12K+ candle lovers on Instagram"
- Instant add-to-cart from homepage

**Product Pages**:
- High-quality product photography (4 angles + lifestyle shot)
- Simplified variant selector (scent dropdown)
- Real customer reviews (imported from previous store)
- "Buy Now" button prominent above fold

**Checkout**:
- Single-page checkout
- Apple Pay, Google Pay, and card payment options
- Auto-filled shipping information for returning customers
- Real-time inventory levels to create urgency

**Technical Optimizations**:
- Lazy-loaded images with LQIP (Low-Quality Image Placeholders)
- Preloaded fonts and critical CSS
- Eliminated unused Shopify apps (reduced from 8 to 2)
- Implemented browser caching and compression
