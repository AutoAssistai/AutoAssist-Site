# Case Study: Summit Fitness Coaching

## Client Overview

**Industry**: Fitness / Coaching  
**Company Size**: Solo entrepreneur  
**Location**: United States  
**Website**: [Placeholder URL]

## Challenge

Summit Fitness Coaching, run by certified personal trainer Marcus Chen, needed a professional landing page to capture leads from paid advertising campaigns. The existing situation:

- **No Dedicated Landing Page**: Directing ads to generic Instagram profile
- **Low Conversion Rate**: Only 12% of ad clicks converted to consultation bookings
- **High Cost Per Lead**: Averaging $47 per qualified lead (budget unsustainable)
- **Lack of Social Proof**: No centralized place to showcase testimonials and results
- **Manual Booking Process**: Back-and-forth DMs to schedule consultations
- **Premium Positioning Challenge**: Difficulty justifying $2,500/month coaching rate

Marcus had tried DIY landing page builders (Wix, Squarespace) but struggled with:
- Generic templates that didn't convey premium positioning
- Poor mobile experience (60% of traffic came from mobile)
- Lack of integration with booking and CRM systems
- Slow load times affecting ad quality scores

## Our Approach

### Discovery (Days 1-2)

- Reviewed ad campaigns: Facebook Ads and Instagram targeting busy professionals 35-50
- Analyzed competitor landing pages: Identified 5 successful patterns in premium coaching space
- Client interviews: Spoke with 3 past clients to understand decision factors
- Heat map analysis of DIY landing page: Visitors scrolled but didn't engage with CTA

### Key Insights

1. **Target Audience**: High-income professionals who value results over price
2. **Decision Factors**: Social proof, credentials, transformation stories, time commitment
3. **Friction Points**: Long booking process, unclear pricing/commitment
4. **Trust Builders**: Video content, detailed testimonials, certifications

### Strategy

We designed a conversion-focused landing page with:

1. **Multi-Step Lead Form**: Pre-qualify prospects by budget and commitment level
2. **Video Testimonials**: Showcase 3 client transformations (30-second clips)
3. **Clear Value Proposition**: "Results in 90 Days or Money Back"
4. **Social Proof Throughout**: Certifications, media features, client count
5. **Single, Strong CTA**: "Book Free Strategy Call"
